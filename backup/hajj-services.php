                    <p>
                        Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to the Muslim’s holiest city since Hajj is the fifth pillar of Islamic practice for every Muslim, with the physical and financial ability to undertake the journey to Makkah, Saudi Arabia. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The five-to-six-day pilgrimage is a once-in-a-lifetime obligation for all Muslims with the physical and financial ability to undertake the journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every year of Dhu al-Hajj, the last month of the Islamic Hijri lunar calendar, millions of Muslims from around the world gather their savings to “attend the epic journey’’ towards Makkah and perform the rituals of Hajj. There’s no journey, no spiritual experience, nor such a chance to connect with Allah quite as substantial as Hajj, for it denotes both the outward act of physically traveling and the inward act of every Muslim’s contemplation of their faith. Such a journey comes with numerous sacrifices, strength, and unimaginable rewards.

                        The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made it far easier for prospective Hajj applicants to get their travel visas in a short period. Therefore, we help facilitate the issuing of Visas to individuals going to Saudi Arabia based on applications submitted via our office. Then, one would have to wait for a few days till the visa processing was done and applications were approved to visit Saudi Arabia.

                    <p>
